# Unsupervised Learning Models
The *Unsupervised_[seeds_dataset].ipynb* Colab Notebook consists of Unsupervised Learning Models like K-Means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

## Dataset
The dataset used is the "seeds" dataset [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/236/seeds] from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It has 7 features and 210 instances of real data type. The data provided is clean and does not have any missing values. The dataset can be used for the tasks of classification and cluster analysis.

The examined group comprised kernels belonging to three different varieties of wheat: Kama, Rosa and Canadian, 70 elements each, randomly selected for
the experiment. High quality visualization of the internal kernel structure was detected using a soft X-ray technique. The images were recorded on 13x18 cm X-ray KODAK plates. Studies were conducted using combine harvested wheat grain originating from experimental fields, explored at the Institute of Agrophysics of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Lublin.
